# CSI-Project-2022
This is the project where the dataset was just a small sample but the whole idea was to predict surgery success or failure using the patients inputs through the website.
However, the dataset is not upto the mark. The dataset for efficient working of this project can be attributes like the age, surgery happened before or ot, symptoms, surgeon, hospital etc. Such datasets are rare to find and hospitals usually do not provide. So here is just a sample dataset and machine learning using classification project.
